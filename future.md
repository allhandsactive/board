Got an idea for a new project for the space? If you can't do it yourself, send an email to <board@allhandsactive.org> and we'll help you figure it out!

* Scan and archive old membership and liability forms
  * Figure out how long we need to keep these things - when should they be destroyed?
* Establish guidelines for using contact info on membership and liability forms
